# Description
 My pc recently crashed and I had to do a lot of cutomization again to get my pc to feel like my old one. I figured that's a lot of work I'll be doing from time to time if I have change pcs. So I've decided to create a setup-my-pc script that would do all the customization I need while I relax and have some coffee. By customization, I mean installations, terminal aliases, etc..
 
# Setup
1. Clone this repository. I doubt you would be able to do that since the pc might not have git already installed. So downloading the zip file might be the other option.
2. Extract files to `~/Documents/codes/setup-my-pc` 
3. Change directory into `setup-my-pc`
4. Run `sudo setup-my-pc`
5. Go have your coffee.

Hopefully, have a very lone while... ;p everything should be fine and the pc should look like mine.... yaaay!!!
